# unsupervised-adversarial-autoencoder

A PyTorch implementation of Adversarial Autoencoders (AAEs) for unsupervised classification. This is an extension of one of ML4Sci's DeepLense evaluation tests for Google Summer of Code. The code that I submitted for evaluation is available in [this](https://github.com/zysymu/ml4sci) repository.

The main reasons for the creating of this repo is to fix some mistakes that I did in my evaluation test and to also explore AAEs a bit more in-depth!

**Note**: this is still a work in progress!
