# Unsupervised Adversarial Autoencoder

A PyTorch implementation of Adversarial Autoencoders (AAEs) for unsupervised classification. This is an extension of one of ML4Sci's DeepLense evaluation tests for Google Summer of Code. The code that I submitted for evaluation is available in [this](https://github.com/zysymu/ml4sci) repository.

The main reasons for the creating of this repo is to fix some mistakes that I did in my evaluation test and to also explore AAEs a bit more in-depth!

**Note**: since the .ipynb file is quite large (lots of images!) it may not open correctly on GitHub. I recommend viewing it through [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/zysymu/unsupervised-adversarial-autoencoder/blob/main/aae.ipynb) in nbviewer!
